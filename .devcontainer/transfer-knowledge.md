# Documentation: Integrating Turtlebot3 DRL Navigation into Desktop Devcontainer

This document outlines the steps taken to integrate the Turtlebot3 DRL Navigation project into the `desktop_devcontainer` environment.

## **Folder Structure**

After moving the necessary files, the folder structure is as follows:

```plaintext
/workspaces/desktop_devcontainer
├── doc/                # Documentation files (e.g., images, markdown)
├── LICENSE             # License file
├── README.md           # Main README for the project
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies for Turtlebot3 DRL Navigation
├── src/                # ROS 2 workspace source files
└── .devcontainer/      # Devcontainer configuration files
```

---

## **Steps Taken**

### 1. **Moved Files**
- The `src/` directory and `requirements.txt` file were moved from the `DRL-robot-navigation` directory to the `desktop_devcontainer` directory.

### 2. **Updated Dockerfile**
The `Dockerfile` was updated to include the dependencies and setup for the Turtlebot3 DRL Navigation project:

```dockerfile
################################
## Turtlebot 3 DRL Navigation ##
################################
# Install Python and ROS dependencies
RUN sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-rosdep python3-colcon-common-extensions

# Install Python dependencies for DRL Navigation
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r /tmp/requirements.txt && rm /tmp/requirements.txt

# Set up ROS workspace
WORKDIR /workspace
RUN echo "source ./install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# Clean up
RUN sudo apt-get clean && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. **Updated `devcontainer.json`**
The `devcontainer.json` file was updated to include a `postCreateCommand` that builds the ROS 2 workspace and installs Python dependencies:

```jsonc
"postCreateCommand": "bash -c 'if [ -f /workspace/requirements.txt ]; then pip3 install -r /workspace/requirements.txt; fi && source setup.bash && rm -rf /workspace/build /workspace/install /workspace/log /workspace/.colcon && colcon build'"
```

---

## **Testing**

### 1. **Rebuild the Container**
Rebuild the container to apply the changes:
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Select **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**.

### 2. **Verify File Locations**
Inside the container, verify the following:
- `src/` is located at `/workspace/src`.
- `requirements.txt` is located at `/workspace/requirements.txt`.

### 3. **Build the Workspace**
Run the following command to build the ROS 2 workspace:
```bash
colcon build
```

### 4. **Run Training and Inference**
- **Training**:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch td3_rl train_td3.launch.py
  ```
- **Inference**:
  ```bash
  ros2 launch td3_rl test_td3.launch.py
  ```

### 5. **Access the Desktop GUI**
- Open the **Ports** tab in VS Code.
- Locate the forwarded port for noVNC (default: 6080).
- Open the desktop GUI in your browser.

---

## **Notes**
- The `real_time_update_rate` in `TD3.world` can be adjusted to speed up training.
- Tensorboard can be used to monitor training progress:
  ```bash
  cd src/TD3
  tensorboard --logdir runs
  ```

This setup integrates the Turtlebot3 DRL Navigation project into the `desktop_devcontainer` environment, providing a seamless development experience with a graphical desktop interface.
